# klipper-macros
generic macros for Klipper firmware

some are taken from: https://github.com/Frix-x/klippain
others from: https://github.com/jschuh/klipper-macros

however they've been adapted to function together.

it's setup so that you only need to import what you want/need, with support for other hardware in the configs was well (eventually)
